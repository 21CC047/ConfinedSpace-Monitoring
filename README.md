# ConfinedSpace-Monitoring
Ships have confined space like Fuel Tanks, cofferdam etc. But going inside these spaces for repairs or cleaning can be really dangerous. People have been hurt or even died because of violation of safety rules. 
The risks include not having enough oxygen, removing primary safety equipment, dangerous gases, and not enough fresh air.Our focus is to develop a safety detector using artificial Intelligence in the confined space.Industry standard IR DOME camera with various angles and high-resolution capabilities to capture video footage of the confined space from multiple perspectives.
The live image from the dome camera is processed here with the YOLO â€“CNN model.Object detection model to identify and track objects and people within the confined space, using Deep Learning based AI Model.Alert is made, and Chief Engineer oversees the operation and maintain the ship.
